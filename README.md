# reaper.Scripts
My humble beginnings to script for Reaper with LUA
It contains scripts to help me improve my mixing worklflow, like setting up prerouted and prenamed drum busses.

  CreateRoutedBusses_DRUMS:
    creates busses for kick, snare, toms, oh and room tracks and routes them into into a drum bus, instead of the masterbus 

  CreateRoutedBusses_notDRUMS:
    creates tracks for vocals, guitars, synths and fx busses and routes them into into a "notDRUMs" bus, instead of the masterbus
